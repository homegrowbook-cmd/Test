### 🔄 How to Deploy

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch
2. Merge this PR to trigger deployment
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages to verify it's set to "GitHub Actions"

#### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# The output will be in the 'out' directory
```

Then deploy the `out` directory to any static hosting service.

### 🌐 Backend API

**Important:** The frontend is currently configured to use a placeholder API URL. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Existing Backend
If you have a backend API already deployed, update the API URL in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: https://your-api-url.com
```

#### Option 2: Deploy Backend First
Deploy the backend following the instructions in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Recommended platforms:
- **Railway.app** - Easiest for Node.js + PostgreSQL
- **Heroku** - Classic PaaS
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Good balance of features
- **Vercel/Netlify** - For serverless deployment

### 📋 Next Steps

1. ✅ Frontend is ready and tested
2. 🔲 Deploy backend API (optional - frontend works standalone)
3. 🔲 Update API URL in workflow if backend is available
4. 🔲 Merge this PR to deploy to GitHub Pages
5. 🔲 Visit your live site at https://homegrowbook-cmd.github.io/Test/

- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Build Output:** Static export (fully static site)

### 🔒 Security Notes
